Short term
==========
 - If a dialog resolves with an error (e.g. server is not available when creating a student, or the database is not
accessible), instead of just losing the dialog, show some sort of an informative message, and let the user try again.
If we close the dialog, the inputted data is being lost
 - Proper server -> client form validation and error messages for fields and the entire form

Long term
=========
 - Student availabilities
 - Online balance refill for the students
