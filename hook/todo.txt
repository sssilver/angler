Short term
==========
 - If a dialog resolves with an error (e.g. server is not available when creating a student, or the database is not
accessible), instead of just losing the dialog, show some sort of an informative message, and let the user try again.
If we close the dialog, the inputted data is being lost
 - Proper server -> client form validation and error messages for fields and the entire form
 - Convert model String(50) stuff into Text? Further research is needed

 - Move the various notes out of Student to be separate entities attached to a Student. That way people would not have
to edit the Student to add or modify a note about them, and there could be many different teacher notes or admin notes,
or even CEO notes. Maybe the comments could also go for other items?

Long term

 - Online balance refill for the students
